# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      - working: false
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "After analyzing the code, I found that the issue is in the backend's handling of sources. In server.py, the generate_ai_response function detects when a user wants sources (either through the toggle or by asking explicitly), but it only uses this information to modify the prompt, not to actually include sources in the response. The sources are being extracted from relevant_knowledge but might be empty if the search doesn't find relevant content. The frontend is correctly sending the show_sources parameter, but the backend might not be finding or returning relevant knowledge to include as sources."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "After comprehensive testing, I've confirmed that the sources functionality is working correctly at the API level. When show_sources=true is passed to the /api/chat endpoint, the API correctly returns sources in the response. The backend properly extracts sources from relevant knowledge entries and includes them in the response. I tested with both show_sources=false (which returns empty sources array) and show_sources=true (which returns sources when available). The issue reported earlier might be related to the frontend not displaying the sources properly, but the backend API is functioning as expected."

The night sky background with stars, moon, and clouds animations works perfectly. Navigation tabs remain sticky when scrolling. The chat functionality works well for general questions. The website content analysis feature successfully ingests content from Wikipedia and can answer questions about it. However, there are issues with the Sources functionality - the Sources toggle button works visually but doesn't consistently show sources when toggled ON, and explicit requests for sources don't always work."

The backend API is working correctly - when show_sources=true is passed to the /api/chat endpoint, the API correctly returns sources in the response. The backend properly extracts sources from relevant knowledge entries and includes them in the response. I tested with both show_sources=false (which returns empty sources array) and show_sources=true (which returns sources when available). I also tested explicit source requests and specific AI questions. The issue reported earlier might be related to the frontend not displaying the sources properly, but the backend API is functioning as expected. I've updated the test_result.md file to reflect these findings."
